# cipher_vault

This Python script implements a basic password manager and generator GUI using the Tkinter library. It allows users to dynamically add radiobuttons associated with usernames and their corresponding passwords. The program also provides a feature to copy passwords to the clipboard. Additionally, it generates secure passwords consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The data is stored and retrieved from a CSV file. Users can add new entries by providing the application name, username, and email, and the script generates a random password for each entry.

Future updates should include CRUD so the user doesn't need to acces the database everytime he changes a password.
